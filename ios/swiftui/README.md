# In Progress

This folder is in progress. It will contain an update to the Swift version of this codelab for SwiftUI, better aligning with the Android version of this codelab: [Firebase Android Codelab - Build Friendly Chat](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-android).

So far it contains:

1. Basic UI elements and styling:

2. LogIn screen and a SignUp screen with Firebase Authentication.
3. Read/write messages to Firebase Realtime DB

Future PRs:
1. Adding Firebase Storage
1. Fixing bugs (such as the color of message when Auth'd user's display name is nil and scroll to bottom on message send)
1. Re-writing codelab to include latest updates + emulators
1. Removing the current version of this codelab (currently in the swift folder) and replacing it with this version
