# In Progress

This folder is in progress. It will contain an update to the Swift version of this codelab for SwiftUI, better aligning with the Android version of this codelab: [Firebase Android Codelab - Build Friendly Chat](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-android).

So far it contains: basic UI elements and styling. Follow-up PRs:

1. Adding Firebase Auth, Firestore
1. Re-writing codelab to include latest updates + emulators
1. Removing the current version of this codelab (currently in the swift folder) and replacing it with this version
